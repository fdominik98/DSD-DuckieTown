# Team: DSD
Repository for autonomous driving in DuckieTown environment developed by the DSD team.

The goal of this project is to train and test a self driving AI vehicle in the Duckie Town World simulation. During our work, we are planning to use a TensorFlow based imitation learning algorithm. We are starting out from the base project [Behavior Cloning](https://github.com/duckietown/challenge-aido_LF-baseline-behavior-cloning) which contains utilities for data generation, data visualisation, model training and model testing. We will integrate certain components of this base project into our own solution, then modify and expand them with new ideas to reach better results.
